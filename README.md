About this program 


It's a 30 day campaign, focusing on Google Cloud fundamentals. 
The campaign will start on the 27th of September ✨

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

This program will provide you an opportunity to increase your in-depth knowledge about the cloud technologies and get hands on experience on Google Cloud.
